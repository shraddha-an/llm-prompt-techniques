# Overview of Prompting Techniques
This repo contains notebooks that show you how to execute prompting techniques using open-source LLM.
This is the code guide to my articles published on my blog - [https://shraddhaanala.com/blog.html](https://shraddhaanala.com/blog.html), 
where I explain in detail about the various prompting techniques.

Here, you will see how to run the LLM with those techniques.
Both the [article](https://shraddhaanala.com/posts/llm-prompting-techniques/) and this repo are living documents and they'll be updated with knowledge on new prompting techniques as I read & discover them.
